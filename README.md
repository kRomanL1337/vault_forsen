| [Research on the reliability of borrowers](02-research-on-the-reliability-of-borrowers) | Based on data from the bankâ€™s credit department, I studied the influence of marital status and the number of children on the fact of repaying the loan on time. Information about the data was obtained. Gaps have been identified and processed. Replaced data types to match the stored data. Duplicates removed. Data is categorized. One dataframe is decomposed into three.| *pandas*, *python*, *EDA* |
| [Real Estate Market Analysis](03-real-estate-market-analysis) | Research analysis and data preprocessing for a dataset with advertisements for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg has been carried out. The influence of the area, ceilings, the number of rooms, the date of announcement on the prices of apartments in all the presented settlements and the center of St. Petersburg for the construction of an automated system for determining prices in order to avoid fraud and anomalies were revealed. Based on data from the Yandex.Real estate service, the market value of various types of real estate, typical parameters of apartments, depending on the distance from the center, was determined.

| [Determination of a profitable plan for a telecom company](04-determination-of-a-profitable-plan-for-a-telecom-company) | The mobile operator found out: many customers use archived rates. A preliminary analysis of the use of tariffs for a sample of customers was carried out, the behavior of customers when using the operator's services was analyzed and the optimal sets of services for users were recommended. The hypotheses about the difference in the revenue of subscribers of different tariffs and the difference in the revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions are tested. A profitable tariff plan has been identified for adjusting the advertising budget. A system has been developed that can analyze customer behavior and offer users a new tariff. A model has been built for the classification problem, which will select a suitable tariff. A model was built with the highest possible accuracy. The share of correct answers has been brought to 0.75. Accuracy was checked on the test sample.| *pandas*, *python*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *numpy*, *SciPy*,  *sklearn*,  *EDA*, *data visualization* , *descriptive statistics*, *statistical hypothesis testing*, *machine learning*|

Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms are available from open sources. The parameters that determine the success of the game in different regions of the world are revealed. Potentially popular product identified and advertising campaigns planned. The current period for analysis has been selected. Portraits of users of each region were compiled. Hypotheses tested: average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are the same; the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. The analysis used Student's t test for independent samples.| *pandas*, *python*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *numpy*, *SciPy*,  *sklearn*,  *EDA*, *data visualization* , *descriptive statistics*, *statistical hypothesis testing*, *machine learning*|

A preliminary analysis of the use of tariffs on a sample of customers was carried out, the behavior of customers when using the operator's services was analyzed and the optimal sets of services for users were recommended. Hypotheses about the difference in revenue of subscribers of different tariffs and differences in the revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions. A profitable tariff plan has been identified for adjusting the advertising budget. A system has been developed that can analyze customer behavior and offer users a new tariff. A model has been built for the classification problem, which will select a suitable tariff. A model was built with the highest possible accuracy. The share of correct answers has been brought to 0.75. Accuracy was checked on the test sample.| *pandas*, *python*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *numpy*, *SciPy*,  *sklearn*,  *EDA*, *data visualization* , *descriptive statistics*, *statistical hypothesis testing*, *machine learning*|
| [Bank Churn Prediction](07-bank-churn-prediction) | Clients started leaving the bank every month. The probability of the client leaving the bank in the near future was predicted. A model with an extremely large value of the F1-measure was built with subsequent verification on a test sample. The metric has been brought to 0.62. Additionally measured AUC-ROC, correlated with F1-measure. Learning with a teacher. Dealing with unbalanced data.| *Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*, *numpy*, *sklearn*, *Machine Learning*|
| [Development of new oil fields](08-development-of-new-oil-fields) | The production company GlavRosGosNeft needs to decide where to drill a new well. Collected characteristics of oil sample for wells: oil quality and volume of its reserves in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known. A model has been built to predict the volume of reserves in new wells. Wells with the highest estimated values were selected. The regions with the maximum total profit of the selected wells have been identified. A model has been built to determine the region where production will bring the greatest profit. Potential profits and risks were analyzed using Bootstrap technique.| *Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*, *sklearn*, *math*, *numpy*, *SciPy*, *Bootstrap*, *Machine Learning*|
| [Machine Learning model for a gold mining company](09-ML-model-for-a-gold-mining-company) | The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of the gold mining industry.

A model has been built and trained to help optimize production in order not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.| *Pandas*, *sklearn*, *numpy*, *Seaborn*, *Matplotlib*, *math*, *Machine Learning*|
| [The Algorithm for data protection](10-data-protection) | To protect the data of clients of the insurance company, data conversion methods have been developed so that it would be difficult to recover personal information from them. Data preprocessing was carried out. The operation of the algorithm of the linear regression model when multiplied by an invertible matrix is checked. The effect of multiplication on an invertible matrix and then multiplication on an inverse invertible matrix is checked. The R2 metric of the Linear Regression was checked on identical data - first the original data, then multiplied by an invertible matrix, the size of which is equal to the number of features. The metrics are completely the same. It can be concluded that the algorithm works.| *Pandas*, *numpy*, *sklearn*, *Machine Learning*|

Users can edit and add product descriptions, just like in community wikis. That is, clients suggest their edits and comment on others' changes. The model was trained to classify comments into positive and negative. Analyzed a dataset with markup on the toxicity of edits. A model with a quality metric F1 of at least 0.75 was built.
